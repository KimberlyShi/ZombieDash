# ZombieDash
Zombie Dash is an interactive game developed in my UCLA CS 32 class, Winter 2019. Penelope Dolittle treks through mazes to try to rescue frightened citizens from brainless, drooling citizens. 

ZOMBIES
Although all the zombies look the same, some zombies are smart and will try to move towards Penelope or the citizens while some zombies move aimlessly. Zombies vomit and can harm citizens and Penelope. There are vaccines that Penelope can collect to heal herself. 

WEAPONS
Penelope can collect landmines and deploy those landmines. If anything steps on the landmine, then it will explode. Penelope can also collect fuel and use a flame thrower to kill zombies but can also accidentally kill citizens. These flames can also be used to activate a landmine from a distance. After the landmines explode, a pit forms and anything that steps in a pit will also die.
